The COMP 3104 Devops course is a course that teaches us how to approach software development, and how development teams
collaborate with the operations team. This includes product design, development, testing, deployment, and support.
In this course you will be often working with Git, Github, where you'll learn how to share projects with other people,
make contributions to other projects, and allow others to contribute to your projects.
